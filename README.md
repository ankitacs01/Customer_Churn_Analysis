# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Using Python

This project explores customer churn patterns in a telecom dataset using Python and data visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

The objective is to understand which customer segments are more likely to churn and why — by analyzing features such as gender, tenure, contract type, and senior citizen status.

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Countplot of churn by gender, senior citizen  
- Pie chart showing churn ratio  
- Histogram of tenure with churn overlay  
- Stacked bar chart of churn % by categories (e.g., contract type)
